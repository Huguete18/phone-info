This code is a Python program that uses the phonenumbers library to get information about a phone number entered by the user. Here’s what each part does:

***import phonenumbers:*** 
> This command imports the phonenumbers library in Python, which provides functions for parsing, formatting, and validating international phone numbers.

***from phonenumbers import carrier, geocoder, timezone:*** 
> This imports specific modules from the ***phonenumbers*** library that allow you to get information about the network carrier, geographical location, and timezone of a phone number.

***mobileNo = input("Enter Phone number with country code(+xx xxxxxxxxx):"):*** 
> This line prompts the user to enter a phone number with the country code.

***mobileNo = phonenumbers.parse(mobileNo):*** 
> This line parses the input string into a PhoneNumber object, which can be used to access different parts of the phone number.

***if phonenumbers.is_valid_number(mobileNo):*** 
> This line checks if the entered phone number is a valid number.

***print("Phone Number belongs to region :", timezone.time_zones_for_number(mobileNo)):*** 
> If the number is valid, this line prints the timezones that the phone number belongs to.

***print("Service Provider : ", carrier.name_for_number(mobileNo, "es")):*** 
> This line prints the name of the network carrier for the phone number.

***print("Phone number belongs to country : ", geocoder.description_for_number(mobileNo, "en")):*** 
> This line prints the country that the phone number belongs to.

***else: print("Please enter valid mobile number"):*** 
> If the number is not valid, it prints a message asking the user to enter a valid phone number.

In summary, this code prompts the user to enter a phone number, checks if it’s valid, and if so, prints information about the number, including its timezone, network carrier, and country. If the number is not valid, it prompts the user to enter a valid number. It’s important to note that this code does not check if the phone number is currently in use.
